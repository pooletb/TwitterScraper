@Drew78823936 @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @RocketTenor @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Probably right. Starship rate of progress far exceeds Falcon &amp; Dragon, although they‚Äôre critical to getting there. dInnovation/dt is what matters long-term.

@DJSnM @RocketTenor @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew For cargo missions, propulsive land landing should be no problem. Doesn‚Äôt have same safety criticality as crew.

@comeaujo @ValueAnalyst1 @Tesla Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays &amp; updated software with battery warmup results in &gt;2X improvement in fleet charge time

@flcnhvy We will spend 3 or 6 months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues &amp; then begin buildout worldwide.

Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case &amp; more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput.

Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%. https://t.co/h2MMBjkzLu

@MM2LLC Yes, but an engine shouldn‚Äôt count until it flies

@compdemon Ukraine did play a major role

@Erdayastronaut @privater @marc_benton @Teslatunity @Model3Owners @Tesla Very little power &amp; only right before you get to the Supercharger. You won‚Äôt notice it in range.

@privater @marc_benton @Teslatunity @Model3Owners @Tesla If you navigate to Supercharger, car will warm up battery en route, so you start immediately at max power

@katlinegrey @lrocket @Alexis_wwww Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. It‚Äôs 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder.

@annerajb @flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel.

@annerajb @flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Yes, exciting potential

@flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Exactly

@SpaceXUpdates @CanzyD Including Heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so

@nextspaceflight Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That‚Äôs scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big.

@CanzyD High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life.

@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos

@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.

@benoitdenayer @navincho @katlinegrey Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars.

@RichPitre_CO @katlinegrey We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done

@Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ‚ò∫Ô∏èHigh engine chamber pressure and ablative don‚Äôt get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage.

@sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey That‚Äôs true üòÄ Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there.

@Erdayastronaut @MarekCyzio @katlinegrey Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for ‚Äúlaunch capability‚Äù. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that.

@Geopilot @katlinegrey Don‚Äôt know

@katlinegrey SpaceX commercial üöÄ launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years. https://t.co/sqAYCCcJtd

@martinengwicht @macodiseas @katlinegrey Exactly. That‚Äôs the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species.

@fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I‚Äôm worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.

@wonderofscience So true ü§° John Clarke üëå

@macodiseas @katlinegrey Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure &amp; temperature in oxygen preburner

@McMurchie @SPEXcast @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX The goodwill of the public is critical to Starship‚Äôs success

@epoxy101 @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX At least 10X cheaper

@SPEXcast @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Very dependent on volume, but I‚Äôm confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth &amp; move to Mars if they want.

@SpaceXFan97 @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes

@Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX This will sound implausible, but I think there‚Äôs a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9

@13ericralph31 @John_Gardi @SpaceX Close

@John_Gardi @SpaceX But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter.

@SpaceXFan97 @alexmd2 @SpaceX Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.

@_cgp @SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.

@John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky.

@13ericralph31 @SpaceX I think 6 where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners

@johnkrausphotos @SpaceX About 11 secs

@alexmd2 @SpaceX Definitely! It‚Äôs amazing that the RD-170 &amp; RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.

@Erdayastronaut @LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi Booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry

@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!

@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Rocket booster temperatures won‚Äôt go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.

@Malcolmmarsman @Erdayastronaut Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads

@Erdayastronaut Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles.

@Erdayastronaut The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just ‚ÄúStarship‚Äù &amp; sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy

@AlexTheChemist @SpaceX Well, my past mistakes do seem extremely dumb, especially the ones where I mistakenly thought I was smart

@nickynaptime Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher &amp; doesn‚Äôt even need paint!

@SpaceXFan97 @wonderofscience @Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.

@wonderofscience @Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Mostly true

@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps &amp; main engines for landing orientation, so won‚Äôt need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably.

@TriTexan @SpaceX Yes

Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).

Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at @SpaceX Texas https://t.co/8JCOi1BG6z

@Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Yes. It‚Äôs very rare to find all three.

@Erdayastronaut @keego73 To be clear, I‚Äôm confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature &amp; reduced need for heat shielding

@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9

@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime &amp; angle of attack

@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Absolutely. You‚Äôve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.

@Robotbeat @zackpio Actual tanks are fine

@Teslarati ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.

@nextspaceflight @Teslarati I just heard. 50 mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night &amp; fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair.

@Teslarati 310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp

@CabsandSurfaces Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.

@teslamodel3fan @Tesla Since it‚Äôs part of safety &amp; security, all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it

Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot https://t.co/x2buQWiABX

@DevClub_Space @RationalEtienne @PopMech Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze &amp; block cooling channels.

@thecla6771 Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings &amp; signs in each country.

@PopMech When going to ~1750 Kelvin, specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization, which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water

@MKBHD @BenSullins @cleantechnica I think some of them should combine forces. Talent is spread too thin.

@WevolverApp @SpaceX Dragon 2 was originally designed to land with thrusters, but it‚Äôs not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars, so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings

@cleantechnica How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.

@musicnick1985 @Teslarati Teslarati is very thoughtful &amp; well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX

@nextspaceflight @Teslarati The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX &amp; Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication

@Teslarati The source info is incorrect. Starship &amp; Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport.

@mcannonbrookes Haha you‚Äôre welcome! Hope you‚Äôre doing well.

@magoo5042 @Tesla Ok

@JP_Cautillo Wow!

@JT_Richards @MMelinot @chuckyyyd This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car.

Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter!

If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:
https://t.co/FZVNlGWYgA

And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it‚Äôs electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements.

There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc https://t.co/lmD3ZNFR9M

@thescalex @Jonas123denmark @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Exactly

@martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry.

@johnkrausphotos @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes

@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we‚Äôre building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April

@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; we‚Äôre using a different alloy mix. I super ‚ô•Ô∏è 300 Series Stainless!

@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design

@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized.

@wangmeister If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference

@alan1bernard Coming soon

@wangmeister It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model 3 orders delivered by year end

@MikeKasprzik @Tesla Try connecting to WiFi

Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can‚Äôt take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less.

Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference: https://t.co/LS4EhN57Mw

@EcoHeliGuy @Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla Autopilot doesn‚Äôt need the guide wheels. They‚Äôre only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.

Are tunnels safe in an earthquake? https://t.co/vxcZ2Hi2qx

@Robotbeat @michaelknaepen @ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Exactly

@Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume.

@MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees.

@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces.

@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they‚Äôre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument.

@FredericLambert @boringcompany You‚Äôre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn‚Äôt include it. We‚Äôre working on one that makes things clear.

@realkrauswife Pop up, park and walk!

@realkrauswife I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.

If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy

A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety.

Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).

@joshjob42 @flaneur @boringcompany Precisely

Presentation starting at 8:15

@CasPiancey @boringcompany This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go

The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start

@flaneur @boringcompany Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it‚Äôs time to upgrade to something better.

All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists

Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city.

@alanrrios @boringcompany Yes

This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla

@oc_isly @TechCrunch Yeah, I wrote that back in 2006, almost 13 years ago!

@annerajb About 10 to 14 days

Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)

Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks.

@MesQueUnBanjo We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release

@ghhaugen Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over 10X the image processing ability.

Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all.

If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps.

@RenataKonkoly @SpaceX Machete!!

@danwat1234 It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car.

Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn‚Äôt exist or would have started much later. https://t.co/NxCgYO9JXx

@nichegamer Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China.

Tesla history trivia: we didn‚Äôt actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He‚Äôd originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later. https://t.co/zPnrrVash1

@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong

@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati The new design is metal

@Erdayastronaut @w00ki33 @Teslarati As far as we know, it‚Äôs the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn‚Äôt need heat shielding or even paint.

Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.

Tracking shot of Falcon water landing https://t.co/6Hv2aZhLjM

@DJSnM Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines.

@Dragonmaurizio We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission

@markkrieger Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad.

Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched.

@Jennerator211 @PPathole @JohnnaCrider1 We‚Äôre adding police car, fire truck &amp; ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months

@bonnienorman @tomb2192 @carpenter_maas Ok

@bonnienorman @carpenter_maas Good advice

@EESNY @teslaownersSV @S100Dfan Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We‚Äôre also working on vision-only driving.

@nikesharora @Tesla Glad you‚Äôre ok

@carpenter_maas Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth.

@carpenter_maas As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic.

Renaming BFR to Starship

@universal_sci No, we‚Äôre just going to accelerate BFR

@YoBigBrotha Yes

Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster

Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.

@scottymeuk @ScaleyMurrsuit No, it‚Äôs got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered.

@FredericLambert @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast

@tsrandall @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.

@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Lot on our plate, so it‚Äôs either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster.

@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Ok

@ScaleyMurrsuit Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That‚Äôs a great van. We will inquire.

@WillFealey Absolutely agree

@WillFealey Investigating

@vincent13031925 @jsteinerman Probably mid 2019

@LION_LIFER Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery

@WillFealey Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not.

@acevedo_lex @stars4a_amy @Tesla Should be possible. Please ask service &amp; lmk response.

@ajaotj36 No, but perhaps in a few years

@stars4a_amy Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app.

@jsteinerman Haha, just like Super Troopers

@WillFealey Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner

@FrameshiftShark Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive.

@FrameshiftShark Radical change

Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive.

@annerajb It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level

It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler. https://t.co/gRpj5uaS0N

@karaswisher Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.

@kenlacovara Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)

Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for ‚Äúgrant money‚Äù. They earn ü•ú vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?

@SeanGVarney That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term.

We know we‚Äôll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe?

If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people.

@tizmagik @TeslaSupport Fair point, will reenable

@mihk101 Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety.

Please lmk what you‚Äôd most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!

@exzacklyright @MKBHD @austinnotduncan @Tesla Cool

@Tesla With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster

@Erdayastronaut @Tesla Yes

@Tesla Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.

@Erdayastronaut @annerajb No, we‚Äôre building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas

@Erdayastronaut @annerajb Won‚Äôt land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield &amp; high Mach control surfaces are what we can‚Äôt test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.

@annerajb Aiming for orbital flight by June

@DatHandsomeJerk @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Aspirationally, they will be made to the exact same specification, but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation

@annerajb @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa &amp; South America end of next year, with broader expansion in 2020

@annerajb @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China &amp; Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases.

@vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible.

@vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner.

@Teslarati Amazing results by @Panasonic at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!

@SnazzyQ @FredericLambert Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll make it right

@CGasparino @Tesla The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Can‚Äôt wait.

@Model3Owners Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought 3P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.

@Lindowitz @FredericLambert It‚Äôs a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model 3 Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action ‚Ä¶

@CGasparino @Tesla Exactly, this is total bs. What part of ‚Äúproduction hell‚Äù sounds like a sure thing!?

@sk2sno @rtk86 @sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla We will enable track mode for all performance cars

@FredericLambert It was underpriced. Anyway, if you want $5k refund &amp; free Supercharging turned off, we will do that.

@rtk86 @sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund

@ctgm @FredericLambert Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer

@FredericLambert Didn‚Äôt you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don‚Äôt get that.

@annerajb @FredericLambert @pjj_knowles @yames51 @DigitalDunzey Exactly. That‚Äôs Monday.

@officialjaden Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after 10M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm.

@pjj_knowles @yames51 @DigitalDunzey No, but I will

@cleantechnica Model 3 was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements &amp; no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model 3 was product alone.

@mikearildbrown @MartyHungerford Same

@KevinJawbreaker 2025

How‚Äôd they know!? https://t.co/AZh4EOrgmc

@MartyHungerford Around mid 2019

@houmanhemmati @FredericLambert There have been hundreds of improvements to fit &amp; finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past.

@FredericLambert Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose

@FredericLambert Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldn‚Äôt look like a radiator grill opening.

Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there‚Äôs no such thing as a Tesla ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week.

To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want.

@cleantechnica Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars

Model 3 long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so

@dennishegstad It‚Äôs kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see.

Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just don‚Äôt use sport/summer tires.

@DannyMekic It‚Äôs a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February

@smeranda Yes, aiming for next few months

@ajmarquez True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time.

Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year

Just reviewed Tesla‚Äôs service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.

@JacksMacintosh @SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip

@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert I believe it‚Äôs $5k

@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.

@j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000%

@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU.

@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude.

@martyeuler @MebFaber Fair point üòÄ

@MebFaber When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they‚Äôre just ‚Äúpassive‚Äù managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!

@MebFaber Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative ‚Äî it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide. https://t.co/7jk2Bs56HR

@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam

@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The big funds can &amp; will, as they‚Äôre suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for ‚Äúpassive‚Äù index tracking.

@dlauer @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder

@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don‚Äôt realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return.

@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators

@Erdayastronaut I hope to be less wrong over time

@ParkerWoolfolk Increased tire pressure improves range. Also, if you have performance tires, they are stickier. Better handling, but slightly lower range.

@ftomenko @Tesla üòÄ

@ctbarker32 Apologies, we‚Äôre upgrading our logistics system, but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. Started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load.

@slashdot Tricky one

@DMC_Ryan Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners who‚Äôd like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun &amp; morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!

@NASASpaceflight Probably 2028 for a base to be built

Mars Base Alpha https://t.co/O1llQp8rFY

https://t.co/Fn0hKJd3uJ

@LanceUlanoff Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car.

@LanceUlanoff Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good.

@LanceUlanoff Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at https://t.co/CftQ1v9YCL

@LanceUlanoff Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric.

@martinengwicht @BlondesE A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car

@LanceUlanoff Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side

@LanceUlanoff Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts

Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details

@MartenBenjamin @NHTSAgov @Tesla Exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. ‚Äú5 star‚Äù just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much.

@Cardoso @NHTSAgov Haha true

.@NHTSAgov will post final safety probability stats soon. Model 3 has a shot at being safest car ever tested.

@LindseyStirling üëΩüíò

@primadanna @Tesla @alphacali Wow, glad they‚Äôre ok!

@CJDaniels77 31 engines, but with room to add 11 more down the road. Kinda have to.

@JaneidyEve @slashdot Yes, if there is no listener, a simulation probably wouldn‚Äôt spend computing power on sound

@DanAloni @slashdot Yes

True üòÄ
https://t.co/CS6semhKm6

@slashdot To conserve computing power, a simulation would only render an object when it is observed

@megangale @Tesla You‚Äôre most welcome! Sorry for the delay.

@Erdayastronaut Will do. Love Reddit.

@Cardoso @SoundBoy264 Space Bar

@JaneidyEve @ds23ytube Long-term, there will be thousands and eventually, hopefully, millions of missions &amp; anyone will be able to go

@perthguppy Yeah, Starlink should be active by then

@LisaPadgett @bocio777 @TArkesteijn Sorry! So many bots!!

Moon mission will be livestreamed in high def VR, so it‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre there in real-time minus a few seconds for speed of light

@DMC_Ryan @iamacloudguy @Model3Owners Yes, albeit a beta version. Will improve with V9.1.

@iamacloudguy @Model3Owners Good news on this front. Tesla engineering rallied &amp; this will be part of V9. Going through final testing now.

Thank you for your trust in the @SpaceX team. Greatly appreciated. https://t.co/hqZPNdoMlr

@cleantechnica Will be interesting to see how this evolves over time

@NigelKBaker Will see what we can do. Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. It‚Äôs not sustainable long-term.

@martinengwicht Very interesting

Due to some Tesla owners encountering system issues yesterday, the free Supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night https://t.co/Hbb7KTE685

@beardyman This is definitely worth thoughtful debate. What might we do differently to improve human/life happiness?

@LanceUlanoff @SpaceX @NASA Yes, I do

@thepixelgeek üòâ

@megangale @Tesla Sorry, we‚Äôve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. We‚Äôre making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly.

@RoxanaDaneshjou @boringcompany Awesome üòé

@johnkoetsier Design has been changed so the üöÄ lands on legs that extend from the tips of the three fins, two of which actuate (mostly for pitch control)

@nirbheek Sorry, it‚Äôs not really sustainable at volume production &amp; doesn‚Äôt incent optimal behavior. We probably should have ended this earlier.

@ddkilzer Yes

@thereal_scottv Yeah, that‚Äôs our problem. Service &amp; parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks.

@SnazzyQ Outside repair shops are jack of all trades, which means supporting 1000‚Äôs of makes &amp; models. Tesla collision repair specializes in three. Having all parts in stock &amp; not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of difference.

Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.

Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour.

Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy

@FredericLambert @pooktd The multi-coat colors (pearl white &amp; red) are hardest, red especially, as it has red tint in the clear coat layer itself for depth &amp; complexity

@pooktd Sorry, we‚Äôve put pretty extreme rules in place for paint &amp; quality in general. If need be, we‚Äôre repainting/replacing entire sections of car or building whole new cars. Got to be done.

@McMurchie @alexmd2 @Techmeme @CatherineShu At this point, I want ETH even if it is a scam

@yoda @RMac18 @TijenOnaran Did you investigate at all? I‚Äôm guessing answer is no. Why?

@alexmd2 @Techmeme @CatherineShu It‚Äôs coming, I swear

@Techmeme @CatherineShu Great actions by Twitter to delete bogus accounts. Will increase usage by real users.

@TijenOnaran For the record, my voice cracked once during the NY Times article. That‚Äôs it. There were no tears.

@TheIanChen @Tesla Sure :)

@jwiechers @SwiftOnSecurity I want that outfit

The world lost a great man in John McCain. He was an honorable, kind, brave and fundamentally decent human being. If only there were more such people in the world.

@GrowthHackers This is why a small company with tight focus &amp; high energy can beat a big company without

@SeanHQuinn @yanquetino @Tesla This is utterly false. Fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that bs for years. Tesla Gigafactory will be 100% renewable powered (by Tesla Solar) by end of next year.

@yanquetino @Tesla Most people don‚Äôt realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas car. Electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil changes, tune-ups,smog checks &amp; other service costs.

@j_brorsson @InsideEVs @Tesla @AirResources Most major customers have tried it &amp; love it. Now we need to finish production design &amp; build it, while avoiding dumb mistakes made with Model 3 production system. Wish it wasn‚Äôt so hard to be less stupid over time ‚Ä¶

@InsideEVs @Tesla @AirResources Maybe ‚Ä¶

@AskDrStupid This was key showstopper for me personally. Couldn‚Äôt make it happen, even through expert fiduciary SPV, without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by regulators. Current rules have good intentions, but make wealth creation harder for small investors.

@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert The extension cord was 1000 miles long, but still

@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert What‚Äôs cool is that it was driven across the country alone (no escort or any accompanying vehicles), using the existing Tesla Supercharger network and an extension cord

@Tesla In talking to our public investors, most were supportive of optimizing for long-term value creation over quarterly earnings. This was also a factor in remaining public.

@nichegamer It‚Äôs almost done

@thatspacegeek Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX)

@FredericLambert No change

Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares &amp; go private

@heydave7 Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.

@Gfilche My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we‚Äôre private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity‚Äôs SpaceX investment.

@danfromtheweb I made that up tbh. They did not have phones during the French Revolution. They used Friendster.

@danfromtheweb Don‚Äôt make me bite my thumb at you

@JaneidyEve For sure

@danfromtheweb Btw, 1792 is calling &amp; wants its method of execution back. Seriously, what museum do you plan to raid?

@annerajb @boringcompany Yeah, great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime &amp; save lives of many birds.

No kidding https://t.co/Vz3FdEO7Ud

@annerajb @danfromtheweb Yes, that will probably be its first use

@danfromtheweb Phew üòÖ. Yeah, we had a drain block 3 months ago &amp; people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?

@danfromtheweb I apologized. Do you stand by your guillotine statement or not?

@danfromtheweb Figuratively, literally or both?

@geekypastimes That has always been our goal

@annerajb @Flyfiddlesticks @patrickc @stevesi This chart only shows globally competed commercial launches, not US government missions. ‚ÄúOther US‚Äù refers to Boeing &amp; Lockheed. Their skill at obtaining govt contracts &amp; subsidies vastly exceeds ours.

@vincent13031925 @bonnienorman @Jason @scottwww Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future, but last week we had over 2000 S/X and 5000 Model 3 *new* net orders.

@DMC_Ryan Definitely. We gave up some grip &amp; width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires &amp; wider on rear for best performance. You might get 3.3 sec 0-60 mph or better with optimized rims &amp; tires.

@adamchavez Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone.

@adamchavez As this well-written article suggests, my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths &amp; suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness &amp; according to specifications from the dive team leader.

@lrroberts87 Good point

@nealboudette @BertelSchmitt @AmazingChevVolt I have never donated to a SuperPAC

@danielbrennan Yes, about 0.5% of what I donated to @SierraClub, which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue

Reports that I am a top donor to GOP are categorically false. I am not a top donor to any political party.

Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth. https://t.co/mm0cpaQLsn

@jack_p That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes.

@stfuszn @jack_p So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity

@jack_p Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent &amp; politically moderate. Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me &amp; I don‚Äôt understand why they are not important to everyone.

With my team after a profoundly interesting discussion of history, philosophy &amp; luck with Vice President Wang in ‰∏≠ÂçóÊµ∑Á¥´ÂÖâÈòÅ https://t.co/pHd52YTZD2

Excellent meetings with senior leaders in China. Very thoughtful about the long-term future.

@hohocho Would love to. It‚Äôs been too long.

@aparanjape Prob early next year

@Vivek_17m @thanr The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave 3. They stopped shortly after boys were rescued &amp; water level rose to roof level all way back to cave 1. That was great work.

@thanr Sounds good

@thanr Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.

@vissmeerr @ArsenalDem @pvols1979 @CNET It will happen for sure. Damn.

@greymusic Should drive temp to target. Why fan speed on app?

@ArsenalDem @pvols1979 @CNET Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isn‚Äôt. Wonder why.

@tammyharrington @d20_highroller Damn, now I want donuts üç©

@d20_highroller Yeah

@shplatt @StarFire2258 Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros.

@StarFire2258 You‚Äôre right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but they‚Äôve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues &amp; hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good.

@jonodiener Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?

@jonodiener For now, reply to my tweet with ppm &amp; ppb test results &amp; will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint@x.com, but I‚Äôm in China so that won‚Äôt be working until tomorrow.

@DylanSheaMusic Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.

@jack Great move

@vanschneider Why sir ‚Ä¶ üòä

Stockholm: it‚Äôs not just a syndrome

@KirklandJones Good point

@annerajb Definitely. Can‚Äôt wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters, but back at it soon.

@ZainRaz4 Yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline

Well ‚Ä¶ it looked smaller on paper

Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big https://t.co/WMeNZeksRq

@Katheri93719178 @dtemkin Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue.

@JohnnaSabri @dtemkin It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.

@RockyPruitt @kulpability @DonAndrewBailey @haydentiff @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW Makes a lot of sense

@dtemkin This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it‚Äôs there for anyone who needs it in future. Something‚Äôs messed up if this is not a good thing.

@hankgreen @goodedesign I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow

@hankgreen @eehouls Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.

@DonAndrewBailey @haydentiff @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water

@DonAndrewBailey @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW Please lmk results of your water tests

@DonAndrewBailey @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW When you‚Äôre there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?

@DMC_Ryan Should be very soon. We‚Äôve already made around 100 Model 3 Performance cars for test drives in stores.

@bevvscott @eehouls Exactly

@eehouls No, it means I created jobs for 50,000 people directly and, through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?

@HelloCullen Already have

@blake_kistler @BBCWorld Ironically, the ‚Äúbillionaire‚Äù label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. I wasn‚Äôt called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. Just the scale has changed.

@LanceUlanoff @BBCWorld Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time.

@Sarthk007 @BBCWorld Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point

@BBCWorld Moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time.

@BBCWorld The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as ‚Äúrescue chief‚Äù) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence: https://t.co/dmC9l3jiZR

Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!

@teslamodel3fan @Tesla Ok

Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids‚Äô soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful. https://t.co/EHNh8ydaTT

@Noizey_Man @JaneidyEve That would be cool. I wonder what it‚Äôs like under all that ice.

@EnochKo @Anna_online A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete

@JaneidyEve Yes. Those videos are from this morning.

@Anna_online According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage.

Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage https://t.co/2z01Ut3vxJ

@2morrowknight Thanks, but we‚Äôve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people.

@bweikle According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages

@binarybits @JaneidyEve Tube diameter is 31cm

@JaneidyEve Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation.

Thanks @palicharterhigh for letting us use your pool

@IAmJohnMcMahon I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz ‚Ä¶

@DocJohnG @PewellaClarke @dcliem It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward

@KyleBrubaker Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections.

@PPathole @JimmyVosika @dcliem Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player.

@astrography__ @dcliem Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm.

@dcliem  https://t.co/jL2sPT0NCp

@dcliem Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They‚Äôre prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.

@MontanaSeptic @dcliem Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then it‚Äôs on a plane to Thailand

@dcliem Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure.

@vcastillo630 @adblanche I am an engineer

@sivarajkumar237 @KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot üñ§üñ§üñ§ Python üñ§üñ§üñ§

@dcliem Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.

@KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot Turbo

@Grady_Booch @slashdot C

@ayshardzn Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we could‚Äôve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future.

@DowdEdward Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation.

Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed. https://t.co/t5XRo3gTxK

@slashdot Yes

@dirkbonhomme @JelteDesign @maysacha Yes

@JelteDesign @maysacha Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy.

@abroadwithalec @maysacha Yes

@maysacha 4 handles/hitch points on front &amp; 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front &amp; 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops.

@thanr @ablack82 I‚Äôm in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub

@aiyanaskye Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand

Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best.

Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust.

@VoltzCoreAudio Ground winds would

@VoltzCoreAudio Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It‚Äôs a beast.

@jevjack1 Can‚Äôt be too buoyant

Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does.

@ArkadiuszKula @JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Good idea

@JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack.

@LittleMissFlint You‚Äôre welcome. Happy birthday! üéÅüéâüéÇ

@MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Yeah, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about in that tweet ‚Äî double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying.

@williamwinters @austinhopperrrr @maysacha @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.

@jeremysliew It‚Äôs open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution

@siwgrindaker @erikveen Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.

@erikveen I would def recommend this

@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?

@bonnienorman @TeslaBull @trippedover Interesting

@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Great, thanks

@JamesWorldSpace Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.

@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won‚Äôt come in

@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed.

@JamesWorldSpace SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.

@JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit.

@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power.

@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)

@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you‚Äôre in an air tube, time doesn‚Äôt matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.

@JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.

@cate_long @lopezlinette Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for &amp; parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.

@MelissaLeeCNBC @thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews I know you &amp; believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said

@jowens510 @lopezlinette I didn‚Äôt ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots don‚Äôt work for me. They just don‚Äôt like hypocrites.

@lopezlinette They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don‚Äôt use Facebook.

@thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was ‚Äúdancing her face off‚Äù with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true? https://t.co/jy7sQkZ4R5

@S_Padival @lopezlinette Why did @lopezlinette publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos‚Äôs cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective https://t.co/eaLVIgwm7k

@S_Padival @lopezlinette  https://t.co/ystkbF7p1W

@S_Padival @lopezlinette .@Lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption ‚ÄúLove both these dudes‚Äù. Doesn‚Äôt sound very objective https://t.co/oy1Tz6Cg68

@Rayhawn @Tesla Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so.

@ajs @nichcarlson @businessinsider @lopezlinette Are you 100% certain that @businessinsider stands by @lopezlinette &amp; supports everything she‚Äôs done? Why won‚Äôt Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?

@tombrechet @vassilyk @FlatJannrickles @vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette @Tesla Sounds fishy. How did that go down?

@steveshmidt @thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews True

@vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla‚Äôs most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is ‚Äúone of the greatest.‚Äù Her articles print Chanos‚Äôs view verbatim. This is not journalism.

@scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette .@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you ‚Äúsee eye to eye‚Äù with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?

@TeslaBull What a coincidence ‚Ä¶

@thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst‚Äôs prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.

@stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?

@benjaminpollock @CNBC Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer.

@ICannot_Enough @SimRiyat @gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst‚Äôs track record before hearing their opinion.

Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself. https://t.co/xSG2Mmy756

@S_Padival @lopezlinette Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you‚Äôre  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla‚Äôs biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?

@S_Padival @lopezlinette has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible.

@gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 &amp; @Reuters.

@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?

@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target.

@LittleMissFlint Happy to support

Appreciate all the good wishes. First bday I‚Äôve spent in the factory, but it‚Äôs somehow the best.

@jules_su We didn‚Äôt steal his mug crayon drawing of a farting unicorn,

@rajmathai @Tesla @Teslarati No standard automotive solution could be built in time, so we created a new solution. It is working &amp; has slightly higher quality than the more traditional general assembly line. Perhaps most surprising is that the total cost of production in the Sprung tent is lower.

@pulletsforever All Tesla vehicles come with cabin overheat protection https://t.co/q9fjKckewO

@clprenz @JoeyOstrander I hate whole idea of brands and branding. So much bs. I hope it messes with our brand. Brands suck.

@TheSeanBooker Sir, this will not be some a dainty little buttercup of a truck! Driver‚Äôs seat will be big enough to fit Andr√© the giant (love that guy).

@MuellerJeffrey Wow, great idea! Since it will already have a Tesla pneumatics system, it totally makes sense to add a utility port.

Pickup truck will have power outlets allowing use of heavy duty 240V, high power tools in field all day. No generator needed.

The Tesla Truck will have dual motor all-wheel drive w crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard.

@aMidLifeCrisis It will parallel park automatically &amp; have 360 degree cameras &amp; sonar

What would you love to see in a Tesla pickup truck? I have a few things in mind, but what do you think are small, but important nuances &amp; what would be seriously next level?

@EV20018 @justwidle2 @Tesla ‚ÄúVirtue signaling‚Äù is super annoying &amp; there are lots of phoneys who are actually huge jerks, but jump on every social cause du jour. But I‚Äôm really proud of the fact that # of changes Tesla had to make to achieve 100/100 (before even knowing about the LGBTQ index) was zero.

@GetMyGist As individuals, we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic timescale. What can live on for long time is civilization. Those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death &amp; hardship than those who stay. Over time, space travel will be safe &amp; open to all.

@xkcdComic This doesn‚Äôt take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla.

@bizwiz1980 @xkcdComic A billion at most, so 20% max. Still basically in the nick of time from an age-of-Earth standpoint.

@lazarusrang Humanity is not perfect, but it‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got

@xkcdComic Could be very close call. Earth is ~4.5B years old &amp; sun will expand to heat Earth beyond livable temp in ~0.5B years, so if advent of civilization took 10% longer, it wouldn‚Äôt have happened at all.

@cybik Yes

@CateLuvsLondon @vicentes @S_Padival @bourgeoisalien @jacobinmag When I was a kid, I built model airplanes, trainsets, rockets (mixed my own powder), explosives (kinda surprised I still have all fingers), a radio, lots of software. Built a primitive MRI machine in college.

@vicentes @S_Padival @bourgeoisalien @jacobinmag Yeah, but I‚Äôm not sure what the big deal is. I like building things. If that ends up being useful work too, even better.

@cfarivar There is more, but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop Tesla from reaching its goals. With 40,000 people, the worst 1 in 1000 will have issues. That‚Äôs still ~40 people.

@erikbryn @vplikeTRUMP @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM Today. It‚Äôs kinda there in US with welfare but rules are messed up and amount is too low.

@vplikeTRUMP @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM Also think there should be a universal basic income that doesn‚Äôt change even if you get a job. Productivity should be rewarded.

@adultswim Because honey is a vegetable

@Santiago7K @xJawz @joerogan Considerably less so than our competitors (longer discussion)

@vplikeTRUMP @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.

@PeacefulChaos7 @DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan Exactly

@jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM He‚Äôs obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak &amp; a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation.

@EvilCorpGame Great name. A little on the nose.

@DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan That‚Äôs really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what ‚Äúmoney‚Äù is.

@xJawz @joerogan Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above 50% too negatively affects economic output.

@maysacha @JayPrisefighter @cfarivar Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga &amp; spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!

@JayPrisefighter @cfarivar They also poured the concrete &amp; built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And it‚Äôs way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!

@joshsteimle @monongahelaEX @AntVenom No

@cfarivar Needed another general assembly line to reach 5k/week Model 3 production. A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks. Tesla team kfa!! Gah, love them so much ‚ô•Ô∏èüöòüí´

@goombar3 We‚Äôve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via 3rd parties.

@taimurstriker Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.

@iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show.

@iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) &amp; other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America.

@mk_rodgers They started it &amp; attacked me personally

@haymarketbooks Engels wrote 2nd &amp; 3rd volumes based on Marx‚Äôs ‚Äúnotes‚Äù. Less reliable.

@JimPuzzanghera Congratulations to LA Times and Patrick Soon-Shiong!

@spookyozzy @slack2thefuture @doctorow You‚Äôre just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at 17 by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said I‚Äôd fail &amp; be back in 3 months.

@TeslaCharts I don‚Äôt want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past.

@slack2thefuture @doctorow You think all companies are bad and all unions good? That‚Äôs a very bigoted position.

Well said https://t.co/lDPaIPLLzO

@TeslaCharts Then you‚Äôll be fine

@JohnnaSabri @indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.

@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow ...which clearly doesn‚Äôt work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what‚Äôs happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they‚Äôre getting desperate.

@doctorow @dimas_______ @Robotbeat Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread.

@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).

@TeslaCharts How big is your short position? Just curious.

@BobbieBees @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guy‚Äôs claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.

@doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right.

@dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow UAW doesn‚Äôt have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can‚Äôt even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they‚Äôre getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps.

@TheSithSeth @doctorow I‚Äôm not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can‚Äôt compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don‚Äôt want Tesla to die too.

@Robotbeat @doctorow I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people.

@AntVenom @Shaynooooo @kausthav_ray @SpaceX Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult.

@doctorow Iain certainly wasn‚Äôt pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn‚Äôt be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that‚Äôs a special case.

@tinytacotown My father has no money. Only reason he even has a house is because my brother &amp; I bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to others. That obviously failed.

@CarltonTSC There is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption &amp; wealth as labor allocation. By latter measure, anyone in govt whose budget exceeds $1B is a billionaire. Government is the largest corporation.

Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict people‚Äôs freedom.

Difficult, but necessary Tesla reorg underway. My email to the company has already leaked to media. Here it is unfiltered: https://t.co/4LToWoxScx

@NabilZouhir1 @mayemusk @kimbal That is actual footage

@mayemusk @kimbal Back in the Precambrian era when the main form of life was a sponge

@joerogan @Off_thewalls @MKBHD Thanks! Have heard universally great things about your podcasts.

@garyflickinger @OchamsRazr @VR0NLINE Of course, but it‚Äôs the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet &amp; anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; we‚Äôre never going to make them again.

@Erdayastronaut @Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons

@Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It‚Äôs what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust ‚Äî literally bulletproof.

@Caio_1999_ @LanceUlanoff Not recommended for urban environments

@ThatGuyKnapp @LanceUlanoff Yes

@poriya_ravi @WorldAndScience The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I‚Äôm thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda.

@oheather1337 @WorldAndScience It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.

@WorldAndScience Love this design. Simpler the better.

@DeeLex_MCEM @VHollywood21 Add an R for Roadster üëΩüíïüöÄ

@raptorweb Sigh. This is crux of matter: can‚Äôt make system too annoying or people won‚Äôt use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can‚Äôt allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially.

@Off_thewalls @MKBHD @joerogan A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.

@VHollywood21 Yes. Hopefully, I‚Äôm not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing.

@MKBHD Will do

@bartjehoel @djenkins6 Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there‚Äôs no escaping Newton‚Äôs Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha.

@MKBHD You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don‚Äôt think there will be another.

@LanceUlanoff Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time.

@LanceUlanoff Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the ‚Äúhalo crown‚Äù effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric.

@anandrajk @lexiheft @Tesla That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features.

This is why I‚Äôm not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I‚Äôd know everything‚Äôs fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh ü§î

Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2.

@trace_remick @FredericLambert 20 years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your üß† like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?‚Ç¨}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.

@FredericLambert In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That company‚Äôs name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony.

@FredericLambert That‚Äôs quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents https://t.co/HPK5R5UMS6

At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps.

More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)

@FrankIppolito @boringcompany We don‚Äôt think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k.

@djenkins6 Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further.

19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way‚Ä¶

SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly ‚Ä¶

@teslaology @DMC_Ryan @Tesla We‚Äôre building out Tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast &amp; excellent outcome

@DMC_Ryan Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model 3 pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model 3 Performance version.

@pmnordkvist Gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.

@Nate_072 @SpaceX Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with 50% larger inner diameter

And we‚Äôre definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.

@MKBHD Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form ‚Ä¶

Running track in @SpaceX BF Spaceship will look something like this https://t.co/563upTfV58

@DMC_Ryan No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model 3 will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S &amp; X w HW2 Autopilot &amp; all Model 3 cars.

@Heretic_Soul @Model3Owners Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob won‚Äôt offer Model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value.

@Model3Owners Model 3 Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. It‚Äôs a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model 3 cars in stores within 4 to 6 week‚Äôs.

@DanielaAtHome8 Usually, they don‚Äôt even realize it. All they know is that some PR agency is pushing a story that will get clicks. That is the true nature of the corruption. It is rare that US media knowingly writes a false story just for clicks, but they are often manipulated into doing so.

@NathanWickland @STcom Actually true!

@KumJm @STcom Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability.

@STcom But don‚Äôt worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels &amp; everything‚Äôs just fine https://t.co/cg4ooQSrX3

@STcom Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each car‚Äôs exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy.

@STcom The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.

@nashlib That sounds like a fun adventure!

@nickg_uk You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel &amp; it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.

@Arkved78 Model 3 should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little ü•ú on S/X.

Filters bacteria, viruses, spores, pollen &amp; particulate of almost any kind https://t.co/dlQHJfKdpU

@Seanmmvi @OlofTenghoff @Tesla Model S &amp; X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model 3.

@johnny0129 @jeffnesbit @Tesla True, no one is perfect

@JeffreyWolder @jeffnesbit @Tesla You‚Äôre most welcome. More to come in this regard.

@jeffnesbit @Tesla Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading &amp; point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair &amp; accurate in their criticism.

@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Ride comfort &amp; aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but there‚Äôs always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%.

@annerajb @Henry_Pivac Prob 8.3

@Henry_Pivac Yes

All items below will go to all Model 3s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature, press voice button, say ‚Äúbug report‚Äù followed by issue description. https://t.co/ea7FTOn2cE

@prakash_d @grillick @IndianInterest ‚ÄúPneumatic‚Äù means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.

@MacTechGenius @v_g_fischer @ConsumerReports Braking &amp; UI upgrades apply to all Model 3s. Improved windshield for aero noise &amp; suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless you‚Äôre really bothered by them, don‚Äôt replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort.

@v_g_fischer @ConsumerReports Yeah, absolutely

Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports. Road noise &amp; ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month. https://t.co/ZMLPJxmPlM

@NoahShachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying I‚Äôm against science is like saying Beyonc√© doesn‚Äôt know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue.

@neilhimself @AnozieUdemezue @upulie @davidkfried Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didn‚Äôt set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science &amp; I said that was false. Are you saying I don‚Äôt have the right to deny false accusations? That‚Äôs messed up.

@NoahShachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba You‚Äôve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that I‚Äôm against science, then cherrypicked tweets that don‚Äôt represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too

@G_Whitehead5 @DMC_Ryan @Model3Owners @Tesla Yes, AWD P first and then AWD.

@amywestervelt @Billsocalif @RMac18 @weinbergersa I‚Äôve just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest &amp; yet believe that same public is too stupid &amp; immoral to assess their credibility. It‚Äôs amazing that you don‚Äôt understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.

@spacecom @amywestervelt @weinbergersa The Tesla facility is open plan &amp; we‚Äôre not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well &amp; they are some of the worst &amp; best human beings I‚Äôve ever met. You‚Äôre the former.

@ObviousParadox @medickinson @thephysicsgirl No

@medickinson @thephysicsgirl Nano applies to everything &amp; therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry. https://t.co/WQp8j9YkeJ

@amywestervelt @weinbergersa Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world &amp; products that haven‚Äôt been unveiled yet. You don‚Äôt have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches.

@weinbergersa Wow, you‚Äôre ignorant. Don‚Äôt remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law &amp; land you in jail. I didn‚Äôt review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please.

@PolitiFact @PayPal @Poynter Done

@jennineak Have a confirmed real name identity section &amp; an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.

@DX_1 Be careful what you wish for https://t.co/3mSj15UeIw

Amazingly, the ‚Äúmedia is awesome‚Äù vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very pollü§î

My point exactly https://t.co/PQ7PFqeC3X

@upulie Ahem, you have ‚Äúnano‚Äù in your bio. That is 100% synonymous with bs.

@donny0m Reddit is great

Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media.

@PassionPlanet1 @supernovaslight @lexiheft @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don‚Äôt realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.

@lexiheft @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt.

@dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman I did to any who asked

@dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product &amp; it didn‚Äôt work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it.

@DMC_Ryan @teslanomicsco @Tesla Maybe after you get your Model 3, we can talk about what you like &amp; what needs to be improved

@DMC_Ryan @teslanomicsco But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March 15 is about right.

@DMC_Ryan @teslanomicsco I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good

@eugenelee3 @karaswisher @Jason Gasoline or diesel?

@karaswisher @Jason What car do you drive?

@teslanomicsco March 15

@mainhoonmaun The media

@karaswisher Hi Kara! I‚Äôm open to it. Right now, I‚Äôm cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week.

Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Right!‚Äù  I do actually own https://t.co/1JqqCF9inA, but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News.

@TruthForceSteem @kali0x2a Definitely

@MrNobre There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these üöó üöô and this is the best one üöò

@PolitiFact I just tried to donate, but you don‚Äôt accept PayPal. Lmk when you do.

@adnroy Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do

@southtopia Thank you! I thought it was so obvious ‚Ä¶

@AltWouss @jackallisonLOL @ParkerMolloy Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.

@PolitiFact Yeah, I think you do great work

If you‚Äôre in media &amp; don‚Äôt want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it ‚Ä¶

@meharris ü§ó

@ParkerMolloy I‚Äôve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They haven‚Äôt forgotten UAW betrayed them. That‚Äôs why UAW can‚Äôt even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote.

@meharris Of course

@scottwww @JessicaHuseman It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we‚Äôre doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company.

@JessicaHuseman @reveal No, they‚Äôre just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously

@iShashankBhatia Will do

Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)

@scotch_io That‚Äôs why editors are included too

@SophieWarnes We don‚Äôt. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.

Even if some of the public doesn‚Äôt care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves.

@DetroitVictoria Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.

@AntVenom Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join

@Virtualanom Not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army

@sakiwebo Exactly

Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda ‚Ä¶

@dancow @WSJ An exception that proves the rule

@CodyBrown Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?

Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn‚Äôt advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world‚Äôs biggest advertisers.

@teddymonacelli The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.

@jaspar Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he‚Äôs above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again.

@andyjayhawk Thought you‚Äôd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just like Trump!‚Äù Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago.

The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them https://t.co/Ay2DwCOMkr

@CateLuvsLondon @Aceinmysleeve1 @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together &amp; messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts

@Aceinmysleeve1 @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics &amp; backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)

@AustinOnSocial Great idea!

@annerajb @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.

@DeusEx Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.

@UAW @speea @AlterViggo @juliacarriew Interesting he stops at ‚Äò09. That‚Äôs when you drove GM &amp; Chrysler into bankruptcy &amp; lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.

@matthunter Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It‚Äôs an off-menu item for those in the know üòâ

@ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA But ya know what, let‚Äôs test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Let‚Äôs hold a vote &amp; find out.

@speea @AlterViggo @juliacarriew In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it.

We‚Äôre going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?

@OldManLink Good point

@ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of 2 class ‚Äúlords &amp; commoners‚Äù system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much.

@mikeyfranklin @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA More ‚ÄúReveal‚Äù bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; they‚Äôve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article ‚Ä¶

@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 No problem

@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet.

@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!

@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 I didn‚Äôt meet with him

@dinisguarda I definitely don‚Äôt do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can‚Äôt be creative otherwise.

Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.

@rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert @Tesla Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn‚Äôt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars.

@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced.

@samuelrogg @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today‚Äôs Model S is far more refined than initial production.

@rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ABS calibration algorithm

@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.

@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won‚Äôt stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.

@camgfrost @DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Stop, you‚Äôre making me blush ‚ò∫Ô∏è

@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little

@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Complexity is the devil. Words can‚Äôt express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we‚Äôll try.

@teslaology @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations.

@LanceUlanoff The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3‚Äôs have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we‚Äôve seen anything like this.

@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3‚Äôs having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers

@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.

@reveal @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA @Al_Letson Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didn‚Äôt exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com.

@MrsYomaddy @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Gwynne‚Äôs awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.

@Dani21 @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA ‚ô•Ô∏èü¶Ñ

@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs.

@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.

@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as ‚Äúfacts‚Äù by Reveal.

@maxrogo We‚Äôre working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle/squeak &amp; pinpoint origin by acoustic signature &amp; triangulation

@georgechang @Tesla For sure before snowfall this year

@trace_remick @clprenz @ivanovi_ivaylo It can tow far more than rated capacity

@clprenz @ivanovi_ivaylo Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.

@ivanovi_ivaylo With production, 1st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live.

@willardslammo @marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.

@MacTechGenius @marshall5912 @buckycovington Exactly üöÄüí´üéâ! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what‚Äôs happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.

@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius Yeah, ‚ÄúReveal‚Äù was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today‚Äôs non-union.

@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it.

@AKSINGH_S Yes

@KingLutron @marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius Exactly

@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius They can form a union whenever they want &amp; there‚Äôs nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don‚Äôt want to.

@paulmacguyscott Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It‚Äôs like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.

@Josh_Soto They are correct. It‚Äôs awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight.

@JimmyRussellExe It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can‚Äôt tell

@AntVenom @zacharyj98 Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.

@Josh_Soto Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now.

@zacharyj98 Good idea ...

@MacTechGenius That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!

Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don‚Äôt get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.

Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.

@PPathole Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.

Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks

Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track.

Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3:
3.5 sec  0-60mph 
155 mph Top Speed
310 mile Range

@plot_qasc It‚Äôs only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing

@clemyeung Exactly

Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.

@Everman @scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf I‚Äôm about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight

@AddankiSarat You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards

@scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!

@DMC_Ryan Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20‚Äù Performance wheels, black &amp; white interior.

@DMC_Ryan AC induction front &amp; switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output &amp; get double the burn-in.

Working on Model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive &amp; performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.

Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground &amp; ocean to spaceport in 10 to 15 mins https://t.co/VhpfhgdXSd

@andrewbg Time will tell, but so far it appears so

@Kasabiii It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released.

What‚Äôs actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.

It‚Äôs super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage https://t.co/6gD8MzD6VU

@sokane1 @TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins Yes

@TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It‚Äôs not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.

@Techmeme @timkhiggins This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg.

@mayemusk Happy Mother‚Äôs Day Mom! Love you so much.

@RitaJKing Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing

@DylanNeumann2 @Everman Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines ‚Äî quaint, but not something you‚Äôd actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines &amp; trains in general.

@Everman Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them.

@existentialcoms Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange ‚Ä¶

@AnthonyFultz @DMC_Ryan I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp

@DMC_Ryan Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD &amp; performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.

@nextspaceflight A cool thing about the design is that‚Äôs easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all

@joshgans We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom.

Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.

The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter

The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors

@MarekCyzio Exactly

First, it‚Äôs important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while https://t.co/srEp1tf6ZU

Please ignore this thread unless you‚Äôre interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock

@Ataraxia_Invest @MKBHD @HyperChangeTV They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.

@ThePhoenixFlare @MKBHD @HyperChangeTV Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model 3 is about to do same.

@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV To be clear, I‚Äôm a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification

@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV The ‚Äúdry‚Äù questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them.

@amir Can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on what‚Äôs most critical, which is currently Model 3 production. Doug, who I regard as one of the world‚Äôs most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering.

@vegamontesino @NoceraBV @WSJ @Tesla We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesn‚Äôt matter.

@NoceraBV @WSJ @Tesla Not criticizing, just as asking questions. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a really great answer ‚Ä¶

@WSJ Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?

@OmarHoryy @TeslaMotorsClub Seriously! Obviously, I‚Äôm not going to do an April Fool‚Äôs joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh).

@realDonaldTrump To be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing.

@realDonaldTrump We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable.

@realDonaldTrump I am against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. It‚Äôs like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes.

@realDonaldTrump Also, no US auto company is allowed to own even 50% of their own factory in China, but there are five 100% China-owned EV auto companies in the US

@realDonaldTrump For example, an American car going to China pays 25% import duty, but a  Chinese car coming to the US only pays 2.5%, a tenfold difference

@realDonaldTrump Do you think the US &amp; China should have equal &amp; fair rules for cars? Meaning, same import duties, ownership constraints &amp; other factors.

@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block 1 performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block 5. SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.

@kerrbones @nextspaceflight Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.

@EmreKelly @nova_road @nextspaceflight East, to support high flight rates for F9 and dual ocean landings for FH side boosters

@octagrabber @nova_road @nextspaceflight No

@nova_road @nextspaceflight A Shortfall of Gravitas

@nextspaceflight A third is under construction

@DJSnM @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Under consideration. We‚Äôve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected.

@DavideDF_ @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M.

@doug_ellison @DavideDF_ @dsfpspacefl1ght https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq

@AngryPackOMeese @dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Of course :)

@AngryPackOMeese @dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before 2023

@dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.

@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not.

@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy.

Customs problem solved! https://t.co/6D0Fbm8NFI

Or maybe ‚ÄúTemperature Enhancement Device‚Äù

Apparently, some customs agencies are saying they won‚Äôt allow shipment of anything called a ‚ÄúFlamethrower‚Äù. To solve this, we are renaming it ‚ÄúNot a Flamethrower‚Äù.

@TheTeslaShow Early access build and especially Dev build are feature-rich, but the features aren‚Äôt reliable enough yet

@mrvergona Release candidate in final testing phase

@AdamyanMichael No

@TheEnderCobra I think we‚Äôve figured it out

@shannonNullCode Yes

Small detail, but each one will come with a serial number from 1 to 20,000 https://t.co/ZBYEYO6zqu

@AndrewGHobden A snowthrower would be really fun

All flamethrowers will ship with a complimentary boring fire extinguisher

Flamethrowers sold out

@chandlerriggs @TheWalkingDead Of course

@almeidagoncalo Yes

This rocket was meant to test very high retrothrust landing in water so it didn‚Äôt hurt the droneship, but amazingly it has survived. We will try to tow it back to shore. https://t.co/hipmgdnq16

@DuvalMagic Sure

@JeremyHeitman Sentience is overrated

But wait, there‚Äôs more: the flamethrower is sentient, its safe word is ‚Äúcryptocurrency‚Äù and it comes with a free blockchain

@jlgolson Ok

@andressa_ojeda @franke @boringcompany Hmm ... portal gun. Now that would be interesting.

You‚Äôd need millions of zombies for a so-called ‚Äúapocalypse‚Äù anyway. Where would I even get a factory big enough to make so many!?

The rumor that I‚Äôm secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false

@franke @boringcompany Good thing you didn‚Äôt ask about the Freezegun ...

@franke @boringcompany Hmmm

Unless you like fun

Obviously, a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely don‚Äôt buy one.

1,000 ordered already, only 19,000 left!

When the zombie apocalypse happens, you‚Äôll be glad you bought a flamethrower. Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!

Don‚Äôt do this https://t.co/e0q6ax60k5

@MKBHD ATF says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than 10 ft is A-ok. Our design is max fun for least danger. I‚Äôd be way more scared of a steak knife.

@sallyshin Check https://t.co/Il3CWSTPXR for updates

@Davidburrusdds Done

@thenosyt Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model 3 functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features.

@DanielleFong @YoungTreeGrower @TylerDoor @ID_AA_Carmack There aren‚Äôt even good normal parties in Silicon Valley!

@ID_AA_Carmack @DanielleFong Actually, you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in performance. There are other items you can upgrade too (seats, infotainment, etc), but I recommend keeping those parts original.

@Mister_Millard @Tesla That sounds cool. Will do.

@PPathole @Tesla @Teslarati @MKBHD Fixed in next release

@Kreative Vastly better maps/nav coming soon

@dd_hogan Ok

@Jason @Tesla Sure

@kabirakhtar Yeah, it‚Äôs terrible. Had to upgrade old Linux OS and a bunch of drivers first. Major browser upgrades coming to all cars in a few months. Note, will be slower at first until code is optimized.

@sustainableanna @VanSeedBank Similar total size. Maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (I think) feature I‚Äôd like to add.

@IamSamCrompton Sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage basis. That will be a big focus next year, with primary remaining Model 3 ramp.

@MCFlashTube Was gonna say we‚Äôll do all but the last, but that last one sounds like good, cheesy fun :)

@MadsVeiby Should be in next update

@moskov Done

@VanSeedBank I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. Am dying to build it.

@SeanMahoneyAP Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far, so it‚Äôs going through exhaustive testing. The results are blowing me away though and I think you will have a similar experience.

Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners WW for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail. 

So much blood, sweat &amp; tears from the Tesla team went into creating cars that you‚Äôd truly love. I hope you do.

How can we improve further?

@Nicmedia123 We will! At least, whatever is left over after we build the obelisks.

@alhenry1231 The circle is complete

@Steven_McKie Ok

Hats sold out, flamethrowers soon!

@ultralightbeam It does often seem that the most entertaining belief or outcome is the most likely to prevail

@mrcsscco True

So strange that people often believe things inversely proportionate to the evidence. Given a set of possible explanations, why pick the extremely unlikely one!?

@Kwebbelkop Yes

Having a sinking feeling that most people actually do think it was aliens ‚Ä¶

When you get the new Tesla software update, go Ho Ho Ho. There‚Äôs an Easter egg inside the Easter egg, but it‚Äôs not funny.

46k limited edition boring hats sold, 4K to go. Then flamethrower.

I think last night might have been the biggest Rorschach test ever

@planet4589 @CristatoLive @SpaceX Isn‚Äôt it obvious?

If you liked tonight‚Äôs launch, you will really like Falcon Heavy next month: 3 rocket cores &amp; 3X thrust. 2 cores return to base doing synchronized aerobatics. 3rd lands on droneship.

@goodaudz @mtlbagelboy @paulkrugman His ‚ÄúPhD‚Äù is in literature (really), presumably bad fiction

@redletterdave How much is it?

I love Twitter

@rbrome @paulkrugman Bloody hell, I‚Äôm going to have to write a blog. Can‚Äôt fit this into tweets.

@ben_made_new @paulkrugman I would only call someone an idiot if people were mistakenly under the impression that the person was smart

@paulkrugman However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive.

@Youri_Hart Major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out.

@paulkrugman For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses.

@paulkrugman Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but aren‚Äôt (having ‚ÄúPhD‚Äù in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. That‚Äôs what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit ‚Äúexpert‚Äù.

Glad to see that Tesla owners are having a good experience. Working to improve further. Some cool software updates coming soon. https://t.co/16NabnHeuD

@nickwadlow Sorry about that. Thanks for letting me know. Will get it fixed.

@sally_alcot @NASA If things go perfectly, all three rocket booster cores will come back and land. Sides back at the Cape, center on the droneship.

Falcon Heavy launching from same @NASA pad as the Saturn V Apollo 11 moon rocket. It was 50% higher thrust with five F-1 engines at 7.5M lb-F. I love that rocket so much.

Max thrust at lift-off is 5.1 million pounds or 2300 metric tons. First mission will run at 92%.

@ClickHole Hate it when that happens. Some people are so rude!

@WIRED Good point. It‚Äôs just a really bad and fundamentally misleading article that doesn‚Äôt actually represent my point of view at all. Other publications referred to it as an ‚Äúinterview‚Äù.

@humantransit Sorry

@humantransit You‚Äôre an idiot

@WIRED This depressingly misleading &amp; misanthropic article came from a very brief digression at an AI conf, not from an interview with Wired as is falsely implied. This is why I stopped following Wired long ago. There are way better tech pubs out there.
